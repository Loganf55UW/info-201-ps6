The data is data from the World Bank on various countries'/regions' domestic
general health spending per capita, and adjusted by PPP. The data has variables
for 1960-2021, but really only has actual data in variables 2000-2019.

The widgets allow for the user to make various selections that modify the data displayed.
For the plot, the widgets allow for selecting whether points or lines are shown, and what
countries will be displayed in the plot. For the table, the widgets allow for selecting
whether the data will be aggregated by country or year, and what aggregations will be displayed.

The panels display a plot of the aforementioned spending by country over time, and a table
with a collection of aggregations over the dataset, as well as some summaries of what is currently
being displayed within the panel.
